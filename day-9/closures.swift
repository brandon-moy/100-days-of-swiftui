// rather than passing the closure as a parameter, we just start the closure directly
// Swift can also automatically provide parameter names for us - this is called shorthand syntax
// instead of writing name1 or name2, we can use the special named values with $0 and $1

// this syntax isn't necessary everywhere and does make it less clear if values are being used more than once
// if this was a reverse sort and using the values once, then it would be easier to understand
let reverseTeam = team.sorted {
    return $0 > $1
}
// we can also remove the return line because this is a single line
let reverseTeam = team.sorted { $0 > $1 }

// There are no fixed rules about when to use shorthand syntax and when not to, but in case it’s helpful I use shorthand syntax unless any of the following are true:

// The closure’s code is long.
// $0 and friends are used more than once each.
// You get three or more parameters (e.g. $2, $3, etc).
